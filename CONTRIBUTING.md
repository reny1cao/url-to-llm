## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 20+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Poetry (for Python dependency management)

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/url-to-llm.git
   cd url-to-llm
   ```

2. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Start the development environment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Install dependencies for local development:
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   poetry install
   
   # Frontend
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   
   # Crawler
   cd ../crawler
   poetry install
   ```

## Coding Standards

### Python (Backend & Crawler)

- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black default)
- Run linters before committing:
  ```bash
  poetry run black .
  poetry run ruff check .
  poetry run mypy .
  ```

### TypeScript/JavaScript (Frontend)

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the ESLint configuration
- Use functional components with hooks for React
- Run linters before committing:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  npm run type-check
  ```

### General Guidelines

- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
make test

# Backend tests
cd backend && poetry run pytest

# Frontend tests
cd frontend && npm test

# Crawler tests
cd crawler && poetry run pytest
```

### Writing Tests

- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies

## Documentation

- Update README files when adding new features
- Add docstrings to Python functions and classes
- Add JSDoc comments to TypeScript functions
- Update API documentation when changing endpoints

## Review Process

1. All pull requests require at least one review
2. CI checks must pass
3. No merge conflicts
4. Follow the pull request template
