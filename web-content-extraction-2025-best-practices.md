# Web Content Extraction Best Practices for 2025

## Executive Summary

Web content extraction in 2025 has evolved to balance traditional parsing methods with AI-powered approaches. The landscape is dominated by tools that prioritize LLM-friendly output formats, with JSON-LD and Markdown emerging as the preferred formats for structured and unstructured data respectively.

## Top Python Libraries for Content Extraction

- **Note**: Name conflicts exist with other readability packages

### 4. **Specialized Libraries**
- **jusText**: Excellent for creating linguistic corpora, highly configurable
- **goose3**: High precision but slower, good for accuracy-critical tasks
- **extruct**: Specialized for structured data extraction
- **Boilerpipe**: Multiple extraction strategies for different use cases

## Structured Data Extraction

### JSON-LD is the Preferred Format (2025)
- **Adoption**: 41% of pages (up from 34% in 2022)
- **Google's Preference**: Explicitly recommended by Google
- **Advantages**:
  - Easier to implement and maintain at scale
  - No HTML markup modification needed
  - Compatible with Shadow DOM and web components
  - Better support for new features

### Other Formats
- **Microdata**: 26% adoption, mainly legacy systems
- **Open Graph**: 64% adoption, essential for social media
- **RDFa**: Often used with Open Graph

## LLM-Friendly Content Formatting

### Best Practices for 2025

1. **Markdown as Primary Format**
   - Reduces token count significantly (up to 10x reduction from HTML)
   - Simple structure improves LLM comprehension
   - No nested tags or complex structures
   - Preserves content hierarchy naturally

2. **Structured Pipeline**
   ```
   HTML → Clean Extraction → Markdown → JSON Schema (if needed)
   ```

3. **Key Principles**
   - Use clear headings and subheadings
   - Preserve logical content flow
   - Include relevant metadata
   - Remove boilerplate content aggressively
   - Maintain consistent formatting

## Content-Type Specific Strategies

### News and Blog Articles
- Focus on main article body extraction
- Preserve author, date, and source metadata
- Remove navigation, ads, and related content
- Use Article structured data schema

### Documentation Sites
- Preserve code blocks and technical formatting
- Maintain navigation hierarchy for context
- Extract API references with structure intact
- Keep version information

### E-commerce
- Extract product information systematically
- Preserve pricing and availability data
- Capture reviews and ratings
- Use Product schema markup

### General Websites
- Identify main content blocks
- Remove repetitive elements (headers, footers)
- Extract meaningful text while preserving structure
- Consider page purpose for extraction strategy

## Modern Tools and APIs

### Specialized Services
- **ScrapingAnt Markdown Endpoint**: Direct HTML to Markdown conversion
- **LLM Scraper**: TypeScript library with Vercel AI SDK 4 support
- **Firecrawl**: Handles blocking and proxy rotation at scale
- **Crawlee**: Built on Puppeteer for dynamic content

### Integration with AI Frameworks
- **LangChain Integration**: Direct support for RAG applications
- **Structured Output**: JSON Schema validation
- **Type Safety**: Zod schema integration

## Performance Considerations

### Speed Rankings
1. Trafilatura (fastest)
2. jusText
3. Boilerpipe
4. Newspaper4k
5. goose3 (slowest but most precise)

### Reliability
- Avoid libraries with known HTML parsing issues
- Test with malformed HTML
- Consider fallback strategies

## Implementation Recommendations

### For New Projects
1. Start with Trafilatura for general content
2. Use Newspaper4k for news-specific content
3. Implement structured data extraction with extruct
4. Convert to Markdown for LLM processing

### Migration from Newspaper3k
- Switch to Newspaper4k for drop-in compatibility
- Consider Trafilatura for better performance
- Update error handling for improved reliability

### Best Practices Checklist
- [ ] Choose appropriate library for content type
